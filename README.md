### :woman_technologist: About Me :
- I am a student of Systems Analysis and Development at Centro Universitário Facens, Sorocaba Brazil  <img src="https://www.worldatlas.com/r/w768/img/flag/br-flag.jpg" width="30">

- 5rd semester ☀

- I like Back end & Front end programming <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/WUlplcMpOCEmTGBtBW/giphy.gif" width="30">

- Back end: I code in Java and C#..................................................................
(I have plans to further improve my knowledge in these languages).

- Front end: I'm studying HTML/CSS..................................................................
(Soon I want to learn JavaScript/React/Angular)

- In game development I'm learning Unity..................................................................
(This is an area that interests me a lot).

- I've also used databases in my Java and C# projects, such as SQL Server/SQLite

This is a project in html, css and javascript that simulates a chess board game in the style of the game Minecraft. Several official game rules such as piece movements have been implemented but there is still a lot to do. If you like chess and want to continue developing this project, you can create an issue or pull request. Some important items that are pending still need to be done. Like the possible movements of each piece when clicked. The check on the king... and even the responsiveness of the code for a functional mobile version.

This is by far the most advanced project I've done using Java Swing. I present to you my game "Aliens Mini Game"! All programming logic was done in the Java language. All the structure and composition of the scenarios was done by me, but all the arts, songs and sound effects were created by other artists. If you want to know more about the code structure and want to play, visit my repository for more information.

This was a really cool project to build. I used Java Swing to create the GUI and for responsiveness I implemented it with an intelligent Back end. In this project you can register as a player in the system through the SQL Server database.
If you want to know, download or make suggestions for improvement, just enter the repository link. There are more details about the structure of the project.

<a href="https://ibb.co/HdpTBJv"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/Ry4TY5n/pk-1.gif" alt="pk-1" border="0"></a>

In this project I developed a program that simulates Pokemon battles. I used Java Swing to create the screens and implemented many features. The intention of this project is to develop Java programming logic skills, so I looked for ways to set the game with music and sound effects (which is not easy to find in forums). I believe the structure can still be developed, perhaps use project patterns or good programming practices. If you want to help finish the remaining screens and implement new features for the game, feel free. More details available on the repository readme.md.

<a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/km5FPXb/Pok-mon-Click-1.gif" alt="Pok-mon-Click-1" border="0" /></a>

This is a really cool project that I developed in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It's a game where the objective is to unlock Pokémons from random Pokéballs. You need to click a certain number of times to open them. A Pokédex was also developed where there are 60 Pokémon to be collected. It has Undertale songs, sound effects and graphic arts faithful to the theme.

<a href="https://ibb.co/2KBqTy2"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/cTdJj15/hf-1.jpg" alt="hf-1" border="0"></a>

I developed this program as a final project of the object oriented programming course with Java offered by ITA (Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica). In this project I made a console game for the Eclipse IDE. There are three levels of difficulty, and each of them has its own bank of words that are compatible with the respective level. The player's intention is to hit a set number of words without missing all available chances. Note: there are easter eggs in this game. Are you able to take the references and beat the game? I implemented several console font colors, theme music, sound effects and cool screen prints on the console. I am not the composer of the songs, the right to them is reserved to Toby Fox.

This program was developed as a final project of the CTEDS course (Technological Training in Software Engineering and Development), offered by Samsung and Poli-USP in 2022. My group created the Back end in C#/XAML.CS and the Front end in XAML( this in the WPF framework). We used the MVC (Model View Controller) format to create the structure of the project. We also use SQLite for data persistence. More details in the project's readme.md.

<a href="https://ibb.co/5rR157f"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/JvsczhM/code.png" alt="code" border="0"></a>

This project was really cool to do, because it was the first time I made an implementation that could communicate with external APIs in C#. In coding there is a sequence of tasks that were charged in the process. First, you need to register in the system to receive an access token (#1 API). Then, with this token received, the service request is made (#2 API). Next, it is necessary to verify which is the service or services to be executed. Finally check if the response to the service was correct.(#3 API). For all the methods that were possible, I did the unit tests to verify the validity of the execution and to have a reasonable safety margin.
